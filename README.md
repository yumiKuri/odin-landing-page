# Odin Landing Page

A responsive landing page built as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
This project focuses on CSS layout fundamentals and Flexbox rather than visual aesthetics.

> Note: The page is responsive, but no media queries were used.

## What I Learned
- Using `vw` units with `margin: 0 auto` to center content horizontally
- Declaring and using CSS variables
- Structuring each section with container divs for cleaner styling
- Applying Flexbox to support responsive layouts
- Using `justify-content: space-around` and `space-between` for layout control
